# Darkace713's RLBot clone

## Just a repo for personal testing

### RLBot Short Description
RLBot is a program to play rocket league by reading values from the process memory as input and 
outputing button presses to the game.  RLBot works for 1v1 exhibition games of player vs player opponent.  
I use vjoy + pyvjoy + x360ce to acheive the controller simulation.  All autonomous bots that are created 
should be fed game values as input and perform whatever processing they wish before outputting key presses 
as output. The idea is to allow player made bots to be interchangeable.  One of the bots being worked on, 
and my initial project, requires Google Tensorflow.
